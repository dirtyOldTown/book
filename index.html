     Do you believe in destiny? Do you think that everything happens for a 
     reason? Do you ever have that feeling of not belonging?
     My book <a href="#books">I DO NOT BELONG</a> is a story of a young girl desperately trying to 
     find herself and her place in the world after a tragic event in her life. A 
     chance encounter with an elderly American couple and a misunderstanding 
     on their part changes her life forever.
     She is catapulted into a new world searching for her destiny. Will she ever 
     find it? It's a relatable story inspired by true events. An easy and fast read. 
     You can find it on Amazon in paperback or kindle. And all the art
     throughout the book, including the cover, is mine.
     Hope you enjoy reading it. Please let me know. On Amazon, tweeter, Insta-
     gram or Facebook. Until we meet again!
